Introduction
============
This document is designed to guide you through some of the changes that the FAST wind turbine multi-physics engineering tool is undergoing, until complete documentation is made available. FAST v8.16.00a-bjj is the latest public release of FAST under the new modularization framework developed at NREL. The architecture of FAST v8 is entirely different from FAST v7.02.00d-bjj. These differences are highlighted in Figure 1.

The modules of FAST (AeroDyn, HydroDyn, etc.) correspond to different physical domains of the coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic solution, most of which are separated by spatial boundaries. Figure 2 shows the control volumes associated with each module for fixed-bottom offshore wind turbines. Though not shown, finite-element blade structural dynamics is optionally available through the BeamDyn module and loading from surface ice on fixed-bottom offshore wind turbines is optionally available through the IceFloe or IceDyn modules. For land-based wind turbines, the HydroDyn hydrodynamics module and ice modules would not be used and the SubDyn multi-member substructure structural-dynamics module is optional. Figure 3 shows the control volumes associated with each module for floating offshore wind turbines. Though not shown, finite-element blade structural dynamics is optionally available through the BeamDyn module and mooring and hydrodynamics are optionally available through the OrcaFlexInterface module.
