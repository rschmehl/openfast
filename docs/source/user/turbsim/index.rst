TurbSim was written by Bonnie Jonkman at the National Wind Technology
Center (NWTC).

Analysis of coherent events was performed by Neil Kelley, Bonnie
Jonkman, and George Scott of the National Wind Technology Center, and
Professor Jan Bialasiewicz, and Lisa Redmond of the University of
Colorado at Denver.

The turbulence modeling scaling parameters for the GP_LLJ and NWTCUP
spectral models were developed by Neil Kelley and Bonnie Jonkman. Neil
Kelley developed scaling parameters for the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory wind farm models.

Levi Kilcher of the National Wind Technology Center added the NREL/UW
Tidal Channel (TIDAL) spectral model to extend TurbSimâ€™s use for water
turbulence.

Yi Guo of the National Wind Technology Center added the API model for
hurricane modeling.
